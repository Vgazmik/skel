Summary
-----------
Skel is a developing tool for making quick program 
prototypes. By tweaking specified files, a prototype
may be adjusted. Examples follow.

Build It!
-----------
	$ make

Launch It!
-----------
	$ ./skel

About Those Files...
---------------------
Default CON_FILE: conf (included)
Default LIB_FILE: libs (included)
Default FN_FILE:  fncs (included)

CON_FILE specifies which files define function headers and libraries

LIB_FILE specifies which libraries to include in the prototype*
         |
         *-> within LIB_FILE, separate libraries as such:
	
	     STD:
	      stdio.h
	      stdlib.h
	     CST:
	      helper.h
	      custom_header.h

	     ~STD specifies standard c libraries
	     ~CST specifies custom c header files

FN_FILE specifies function headers*
        |
        *-> within FN_FILE, declare as such:
	 
	    FNCS:
	     char* tos(char* msg)
	     double blarg()
	     int main(int argc, char** argv)

Success
---------
Successful prototype creation is signaled 
by a friendly "Hello, Master!", written into
the default main function. By default, your
skeleton file will be written as "outline.c"

Plug In!
---------
Go ahead, give it a whirl, make suggestions, 
peep the source code, help add features, or 
just use it to save a few minutes, and if 
you're not fully satisfied, run:
	
	$ make clean
